#Market Research

-	A viable market is essential
-	Business plan claims should be justified against market research
-	You must be confident of the market facts and figures

Roler has a viable market which is the social media, Creative design, writing and illustration market. Roler targets many markets at once which is a big task but we have predicted that it should work well together but during the start it will be slow to gain traction but shall get the predicted 50,000 users by the end of the first twelve months if not more through the marketing strategy we have in place and the quality of the product itself.

We have predicted that in the first year since we are going to be in the beta stage that we will not make much from sales, apart from getting advertisements revenue and potentially sponsorships through other companies so we can earn a higher CPM on are advertisements shown on Roler. In year two we will make a huge increase in income as we will launch are premium accounts for £29.99 annually, we have predicted to sell around 2500 in the year this will potentially bring us in around £74,975.

We are confident that Roler will make a mark on the market that is out there already and hit are competitors and make them have to either adapt our they will fade out as, we have predicted to have around 600,000 members in are community by year three which is a huge number of members. This would hit are competitors and most likely cause them to change their product.
