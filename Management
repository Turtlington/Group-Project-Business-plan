Management
===========================
Who are the team members?
What do they do?
What skills do they have?
What education do they have in the companys field?
Do we have any weakness?
Who is the leader/ head of the company? This is so we can say who has the final say.
Are we going to hire anyone?
Have we asked anyone for help with the project?


Risk assessment

One would be that we wouldn't create everything we wanted however we over came that with compromise.
What are the risks in the market, would the competion be too much for us? 
Do we have anyone in the company who is a risk or do we need someone that he company depends on?
