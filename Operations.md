Operations
=================
The team are located in the Belfast area, as these locations range from central Belfast to Carrickfergus this can cause problems with face-to-face team commutations. The team has found easy solutions to combat this issue by using social media, the team have access to the Skype for scheduled group online meetings. Google drive and Github are also used to keep track of each others work to see if everyone is keeping up to our self designated deadlines. Due to the fact that everyone on the team can see each others work before the deadline it gives everyone the chance to give feed back on a peculiar piece of work.

Due to the need for face to face commutation with the team by year two they team will be looking for office space to so that everyone will have a space to come work at in a structured environment. This will give everyone the chance to work with more efficiently in a professional manner without any home distractions.

Currently the team uses their own laptops to complete the project these are a mixture of PC and Apple Mac laptops. This will be changing when the permanent office space is acquired. Desktops and laptops will be used as well as other devices to make it compatible with devices.


At the moment the team has four members who are also the Co-founders of the project. They are James McCartan, Sian Finlay, Rebecca Ferris and Stephanie Hughes. They all originally had 25% of the business however after investment that would go down to 22.5% each with the 10% left going to the investors.

Each Co-founder has his or her own unique skills set, James is a ux/ui designer as well as the leader of the team, Sian is a developer with design input who also has a leadership role, Rebecca is a back end developer who specializes in databases and Stephanie is a developer also.
