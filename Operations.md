Operations
=================
The team are located in the Belfast area, as these locations range from central Belfast to Carrickfergus this can cause problems with face-to-face team commutations. The team has found easy solutions to combat this issue by using social media, the team have access to the Skype for scheduled group online meetings. Google drive and Github are also used to keep track of each others work

At the moment the team has four members who are also the Co-founders of the project. They are James McCartan, Sian Finlay, Rebecca Ferris and Stephanie Hughes. They all originally had 25% of the business however after investment that would go down to 22.5% each with  the 10% left going to the investors.
