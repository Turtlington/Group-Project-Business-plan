#Financial Forecasts

##Put a number on it 

-	Realistic, specific, Sales forecasts are you financial foundations

The majority of the income that Roler will get from advertisement revenue on the website, along with income from the premium accounts that we have planned to include when Roler is officially out of the Beta, it will cost the user £29.99 annually but if the user signs up during the Beta they will get the first year for free once we are out of Beta. We will need to get investment for the company within the first six months depending on the growth of the community, we hope to reach around 50,000 registered users within the first twelve months of being live. We also believe that around three fifths of these members will become daily users of Roler. We will be seeking to get around £50,000 to cover the costs of running Roler and hiring an extra two developers to join the team and help to keep Roler running and constantly updated. We will not be taking a salary in the first year and will also be working from our individual houses, so that we don't have to pay rent on an office space as it is not needed at the moment.

We hope that in year two of Roler running that we may reach around 250,000 registered users on the site. This year we will look to move into an office and to hire more employees, that will be a marketing and sales manager to take care of the advertisements and partnerships with other companies, we will also look to expand are development team and bring in another UX and UI Designer. These extra staff members will all get a salary but us as the founders will not until we start to make a profit as I see us making a loss until we hit around 150,000 daily users as we would then make enough from advertisement revenue to cover running costs of the business and other expenses such as advertisements, salaries, electric, rent... 

In year three we hope to expand once again and employ more employees and hopefully have a workforce of around twelve members of staff, we also predict that Roler will reach 600,000 Registered users by the end of the year, if we hit this goal we will be making profits that we can then reinvest back into the company.

*Based on CPM of £0.85 to £5.00, it all depends on the advertisements as they have different CPM's. Also based on Roler getting a minimum of 1,000,000 views per year, also the advertisement company will take 45% of all of the predicted money. The salary is for the developers that we will hire at around six months into the launch of Roler to help with development of the product.

-	Cashflow 


We have started off with £0 in the bank to start of this project, as we are going to work on this project with our own money which we have yet to invest. Throughout the first year of the project we will be working from home which is in and around Belfast so we will not have any expenses for office space, or other essential bills. As well as that we will not take a wage until year two when we have planned on moving into an office space as we hope to expand and be able to employ at least four other full time staff three of which will be developers to help finish of and maintain are product, the other employee will be a marketing and sales manager so that they can go out and do some sourcing for funding, advertisements and partnerships from other companies.

#Financial Requirements
##The Big Ask

###How much you need

-	How much, when and in what form

-	Show how the money will be used

We would need around £50,000 of a loan or from funding through many different areas, also we would like to get around £5,000 overdraft for a safety net, during the first few months. The loan will be used to hire two developers to help us prefect the features on Roler, and to finish of the rest of the features that are still in the Beta stage of development. The money will also be used to pay for advertisements, through out the social networks and other websites of similar genre.

At the moment since we don't have an office the only operational costs will be for hosting, domains and registering of the company as a business once we have an established location for our headquarters.
