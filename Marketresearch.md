Market Research
---------------
During our market research we discussed our target market interests and what they are using at the moment to for fill their needs. For this we looked at that our competitors are doing for our target market. From competitor research we found that users are using  those sites that are outdated and do not adapt to the marketâ€™s changing needs.
