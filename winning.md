We have identified are potential customers through market research of are competitors, from this we have found that their products are outdated, cluttered, and not what the user needs. Rolers potential customers can be anyone essentially, but the main target audience is 13 - 24 age range, that are into creative design, writing, illustrating...

We will make are potential customers aware of Roler through many networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, Blogger along with this we will contact other blogging sites such as Medium, CreativeBloq to hopefully get some more traction for Roler in the opening months of the beta.

Roler will convert potential customers by showing them what we have to offer in a clear and concise manor, with what Roler is and all of it features and what it can do for the user themselves. We will also offer them if they sign up during the beta phase of the project to earn a free years Premium Membership for when Roler leaves Beta with in the first year of being live. 

We have predicted that it should take five seconds to win a customer from the second that they first click onto the site they should be interest to sign up or to stay on Roler and have a look around the product. We know that five seconds is a short time but the average person that clicks on a link to a website that they do not know of normally only stays for a few seconds if there is nothing that catches there interest. 

We will retain customers by being a reliable, quirky on are contact with our members so that Roler will become a community rather than just a collection of members posting and not communicating with each other in one way or another. Roler will retain the members by listening to the community and updating our services around their feedback.

We will build our community through social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, Blogger... Once we hit a certain number of users we will also spread through word of money and potentially recommendations via other members of Rolers community. We have predicted to grow rapidly in year two and double our amount of users by year three.

We have asked a small group of people who use are competitors, once we told them about what Roler is they have basically lit up and said that they would use it as it provides the services of are three main competitors in one place so that we have essentially combined three products into one with a new fresh and appealing take on the existing market.
