Business
--------

Roler has been in development for a total of about 6 months. This is broken down into; two months for concept and planning, three months for development, and one month for business planning. 

Over the three month period of development a simple social media site with gallery and friend system was created. Many features were still in development and being research by the team, such as WYSIWYG editor, multi-page chat with custom chat options, group pages and a comment and posting system. Team members had to work and learn to techniques and increase their knowledge of programming languages during the development. The WYSIWYG editor did not make it on the minimum viable product because of beginner level knowledge of jQuery, this was replaced with a simple textbox. Chat had the same problems as the WYSIWYG editor. The group pages, comments and posting systems need more time in development. 

The knowledge of programming languages has increased now making it more possible to work on features still in development and others that were not in the plan for the minimum viable product. 

Roler is currently owned by the original development team which features two designers and two developers, however roles are interchangeable. This means all members discuss both development and design.

Product
-------

Roler focuses on being a social media for artist and writers to collaborate of stories, comics and another forms of creative media. What makes Roler unique is it key focus and the creative freedom it give its users on the web. Current features that have been develop for this purpose are the art and writing gallery. The feature that have yet to be develop are the customisation and group pages to give the use a collaborative space and more creative freedom. 

One of the key goal of the product is to become a responsive site so user may chat and upload work to the site. As the internet becomes more readily available to the customers they will be able to access the site more frequently increasing the amount of user content on the site that will encourage outside user to come look at the current user’s content changing the nature of the site. 

There is already a market for similar sites like Roler such as DeviantArt which are well known and have many permanent users. However these sites are outdated so users are looking for new options. 


Market
--------

The target market for Roler is young teens and adults between the ages of 13 - 24 who like to draw or write stories. The target market is the most productive of the internet, especially when it comes to sharing content with friends, however they are also in higher education and are starting to think of ways to express their interests and areas of study.


Competition
-----------

Roler is competing against products such as deviantArt, Fiction Press, and Tumblr. Each competitor share either the same target market or a segment of it. 

DeviantArt is Roler's biggest competitor and has been in the business for several years. DeviantArt offers both a service for users to post art and stories. However the stories post on deviantArt are not given much attention and are ofter rare to see on DeviantArt’s popular work page. DeviantArt also has a group and chat features. However the chat is outdate and use old programming languages which don’t allow the users access to them on mobile devices. Roler is built to be responsive so that all the features are accessible on every device, so the chat can be use. Roler als pout more focus on to the stories with a better typography for user to read and enjoy. Art and stories are given equal attention with their own feature tabs.
