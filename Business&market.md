Business
---------

Roler has been in development for a total of about 6 weeks. This is broken down into; two weeks for concept and four weeks for development . 

Over the 6 week period of development a simple social media site with gallery and friend system was created. Many features were still in development and being research by the team, such as WYSIWYG editor, multi-page chat with custom chat options, group pages and a comment and posting system. Team members had to work and learn to techniques and increase their knowledge of programming languages during the development. The WYSIWYG editor did not make it on the minimum viable product because of beginner level knowledge of jQuery, this was replaced with a simple text box. Chat had the same problems as the WYSIWYG editor. The group pages, comments and posting systems need more time in development. 

The knowledge of programming languages has develop over the work making work  on features still in development and others that were not in the plan for the minimum viable product faster and more professional. 

Roler is currently owned by the original development team which features two designers and two developers, however roles are interchangeable. This means all members discuss and practice both development and design.

Product
--------

Roler focuses on being a social media for artist and writers to collaborate on stories, comics and another forms of creative media. What makes Roler unique is the key focus on the creative freedom it give its users on the web. Current features that have been develop for this purpose are the art and writing gallery. The feature that are currently to be develop are the customisation and group pages to give the use a collaborative space and more creative freedom. 

One of the key goal of the product is to become a well known site by the users  so they may access the site from any devices with access to the internet. As the site becomes more establish the site’s traffic will increase the amount of users and content on the site that will encourage outside users to join the site and show off their own skills. 

There is already a market for similar sites like Roler such as DeviantArt which are well known and have many permanent users. However these sites are outdated so users are looking for new options. 

Current weaknesses in Roler are that it is only a minimum viable product and doesn’t have some of the features that we want on the site and will be roll out throughout the phases of the beta. 


Market
-------

The target market for Roler is young teens and adults between the ages of 13 - 24 who like to draw or write stories. Roler is also targeted at hobbyist who just enjoy sharing and collaborating with other people with similar interests. The target market is the most productive on the internet, especially when it comes to sharing content with friends, however they are also in higher education and are starting to think of ways to express their interests and areas of study. The target market are not profession writers or artist but inspire or enjoy crafts as a hobby. 

The target market has the largest proportion of web activity of their age. This market is continually growing with new young people starting to express their creativity everyday.

New web services and big names are moving towards more simple user experiences such as developing more versatile multi-platform sites. As the creative market increases other older sites are becoming outdated and bloated due to attempts to adapt to the new market. Roler provides a fresh name and look to the old sites. A fresh place for the new inexperienced creative user. 

Roler currently has no customer as it is in the early stage of its development. However concepts of Roler had some potential customers showing an internet in the product. 


Competition
-----------

Roler is competing against products such as deviantArt.com, FictionPress.com, FanFiction.com, and tumblr.com. Most competitor share similar target markets or have been use by the target market. 

DeviantArt is Roler's biggest competitor and has been in the business for several years. DeviantArt offers both a service for users to post art and stories. However the stories post on deviantArt are not given much attention and are often rare to see on DeviantArt’s popular works. DeviantArt also has a group and chat features. However the chat is outdates and uses old programming languages which don’t allow the users access to them on mobile devices. Roler will be built to adapt to all screen sizes and accepted methods of programming so that all the features are accessible on every device. Roler also put more focus on to the stories with a better typography for user to read and enjoy. Art and stories are given equal attention with their own feature tabs. Current users of DeviantART will be interested in Roler because of it’s more readable and enjoyable stories writing and reading experience. DeviantArt’s main response to Roler would be a concern for the art gallery which they may cling on to the artists in our target market by developing new gallery features. 

Fanfiction and Fictionpress are sister websites which users write and share their stories in both. Fanfiction is for only stories written on existing characters whereas Fictionpress is for stories on original characters. Both our popular sites for sharing stories. However they don’t provide very good reading experiences for the user, the options it does provide to improve this are clumsy to use and do not improve the reading much. The sites are also do not advertise users’ stories very well due to poor choice of type. In Roler user stories are well thought out and formatted for the best reading experience, user also choose how they advertise their stories with tags. When Roler gains a  large audience and hype to match Fanfiction and Fictionpress it might cause the two sites to rethink their user interface to hold on to their audience.

Tumblr is a micro-blogging platform which focuses of sharing images and small text posts. Tumblr is an example of a competitor that the target market has adapted the site features to accommodate them. What users likes about tumblr is it huge community of creative users who are sharing their work on the site. However tumblr was not built for the user to collaborate together with these creative users which they end up isolated. Roler encourages its user to chat and work together, whether it is art, writing or mixture and still have create ways of sharing and enjoying the community. Tumblr may not response at all or negatively to Roler as it’s focusing on only a small section of their market.
