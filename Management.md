Management
===========================

On the product Roler there are for the moment four members of the team, they are the Co-founders James McCartan, Sian Finlay, Rebecca Ferris and Stephanie Hughes. Each of the Co-founders has a share of 20% each in the business with 20% left for investors and backers.

Everyone in the team had a unique job role in making the product Roler what it is, due to the complexity of the project every team member was essential in getting the final product to the stage of completion. 


##James McCartan
James is the leader on the project Roler, he made sure that the project was kept to the time scale that had been made in the early stages of planning. James was also the user interface designer on the project he created the simple clean design of Roler and made the features easily accessible.

James has completed a Foundation Degree in Interactive Multimedia. The Foundation Degree gave James the chance to develop his skills at a university level while still in a college environment. The time taken to complete the foundation degree gave James the chance to widen his knowledge of the design world; it also helped him make connections that would lead to a placement position.

Jamesâ€™s previous experiences of user interface design on his placement setting, gave him an insight into the user market at the moment. The first hand experience working with users preferences is where the project design for a simple clean website came from, due to users want for easier accessible products.



##Sian Finlay
Sian is one of the developers on the project Roler, Sian was a designer at the start of the project but migrated into the development of the project due to the vast need for another developer. Sian is also the vice leader of the project, she would take the role of leader if James was not available. Sian took it upon herself to learn through tutorials, this was due to Sian not being used to the developer end of a project. As time went by Sian was an essential part of the development team and found useful ways to combat problems.

What skills do they have?
What education do they have in the companys field?
Do we have any weakness?
Who is the leader/ head of the company? This is so we can say who has the final say.
Are we going to hire anyone?
Have we asked anyone for help with the project?


Risk assessment

One would be that we wouldn't create everything we wanted however we over came that with compromise.
What are the risks in the market, would the competion be too much for us? 
Do we have anyone in the company who is a risk or do we need someone that he company depends on?
