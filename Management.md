Management
===========================

On the product Roler there are for the moment four members of the team, they are the Co-founders James McCartan, Sian Finlay, Rebecca Ferris and Stephanie Hughes. Each of the Co-founders has a share of 20% each in the business with 20% left for investors and backers.

Everyone in the team had a unique job role in making the product Roler what it is, due to the complexity of the project every team member was essential in getting the final product to the stage of completion. 


##James McCartan
James is the leader on the project Roler, he made sure that the project was kept to the time scale that had been made in the early stages of planning. James was also the user interface designer on the project he created the simple clean design of Roler and made the features easily accessible.

James has completed a Foundation Degree in Interactive Multimedia. The Foundation Degree gave James the chance to develop his skills at a university level while still in a college environment. The time taken to complete the foundation degree gave James the chance to widen his knowledge of the design world; it also helped him make connections that would lead to a placement position.

James’s previous experiences of user interface design on his placement setting, gave him an insight into the user market at the moment. The first hand experience working with users preferences is where the project design for a simple clean website came from, due to users want for easier accessible products.



##Sian Finlay
Sian is one of the developers on the project Roler, Sian was a designer at the start of the project but migrated into the development of the project due to the vast need for another developer. Sian is also the vice leader of the project, she would take the role of leader if James was not available. Sian took it upon herself to learn through tutorials, this was due to Sian not being used to the developer end of a project. As time went by Sian became an essential part of the development team and found useful ways to combat problems.

Sian came from an A-level background into the Bsc Degree in Interactive Multimedia and Design. This meant that Sian didn’t have as much experience in the outside development work environment before coming to the degree however she has made a lot of effort to combat that by getting to know the industry and learning new skills when she came.

Sian had a lot of say when it came to planning the design of the project and it was only halfway though the first stage that we needed to change the group positions. 



##Rebecca Ferris
Rebecca is the back end developer on the project, Rebecca created an maintained the databases that where used in the project. Rebecca has had experience with this line of work before as she manages and develops the databases for two online shopping websites. The project team felt this experience gave her insight into what was needed for the projects databases, due to the similarities of storing personal data of our users.

Rebecca completed the same Foundation Degree that James had this meant that there was already a working relationship with them. The working relationship that had already been established meant that it was an easy transition to working in a group it also made Sian more confident in the group she was joining.

Rebecca works for a company every so often as and when they need her, they employee her to maintain and update their databases and to fix any problems with their projects for example product images being missing. This work gives her the chance to practice her skills on a professional level, these skills where then transferred to the Roler project.



##Stephanie Hughes
Stephanie was a developer on the project Roler. Stephanie was also on the Foundation degree the same as Rebecca and James. This meant that Stephanie completed a placement position in a development company. The experience in the placement worked to her favour in this project.




In the first year the project team will have to maintain the website on their own and the admin roles will be carried out by themselves. By year two the team is planning on out sourcing the admin roles to an automated service and then have admins of trusted users so there is human admin judgements. This would free the team up to focus on the maintenance and improvement of the project. By year three the team hopes to employ a developer and a designer to help with the work. By year five another four employees and then interns would be sauté after. 

Risk assessment
===========================

In the world of business a company faces many different risks if they plan on their products becoming a success. For Roler there are many outside sources of risk, which include competitors, hackers, and even a power cut could severely damage the product.

A power cut in the office building where the desktops that can access Roler or have new updates needed or promised for that day. If there are no back up files saved on external hard drives that could be taken to a powered location, then the company will have to wait until the power is back online before proceeding with any work. This could be avoided if external hard drives where used and proper planning for example back up generators would be useful in a large business but in a small location moving to a temporary location would be best. 

Competitors taking notice of our project and trying to sabotage it if it is shown that their customers are switching to our service. It is hard to determine what a competitor will do when faced with composition some understand that it is apart of business and others take it personally.  If they take it personally they will be looking through Roler with a fine toothcomb trying to see any discretions that they could get us shut down, this could range from a cyber attack or to a lawsuit trying to sue the company. To combat this Roler will in the next year have provisions to stop database injections, an over look to make sure nothing could be mistaken as stolen from another company and any other safety measures to combat sabotage.
